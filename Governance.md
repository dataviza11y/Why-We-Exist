<h4>Vision</h4>

<h4>Mission</h4>

To identify best practices for accessible data visualization, and create materials and guidelines for making charts and graphs accessible to everyone.

<h4>Values</h4>

Our work will be guided and informed by our beliefs and commitments to:
* Inclusiveness - we respect people, value diversity and are committed to equality.
* Participation - we value and recognise the contribution of volunteers within organisations and communities.
* Quality - we strive for excellence through continuous improvement.

<h2><a aria-label="Link to the section: Subcommittees" name="subcommittees">#</a> Subcommittees</h2>

Subcommittees (SC) produce deliverables to achieve the SC planned objectives.

There are currently two (2) subcommittees:
* Advocacy
* Development

The Advocacy SC focuses on education and awareness activities, to teach and guide as many data visualization professionals (or anyone who works with dataviz) as possible. 

The Development SC supports the Advocacy SC activities with development work, e.g. building a platform to host resources and references used to teach/raise awareness. The Development SC will also conduct research, collect information, and build examples of best practices in dataviz accessibility.

Many objectives will require collaboration between both subcommittees, to be organized as needed by SC chairpersons.
