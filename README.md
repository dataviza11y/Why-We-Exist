Charts, graphs, and other data visualizations are usually inaccessible to blind people and people with some other disabilities, especially certain types of cognitive and vision disabilities.

Making data visualizations –such as charts, graphs, diagrams, and infographics– accessible to all readers is an emerging field, and there are many different techniques for different aspects of the problem. These range from tactiles to sonifications to advanced screen-reader approaches, as well as auditing techniques, WCAG conformance, and different considerations for different disabilities.

Our goal is to find these common problems and solutions, to identify best practices for accessible data visualization, and create materials and guidelines for making charts and graphs accessible to everyone.
